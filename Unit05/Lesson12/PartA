Ali Cole AT Java
Lesson 12 - Variable Scope
Part A

Describe the error in the following program and explain how to fix it.

public class Conversation
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.print("What is your first name? ");
      String input = in.next();
      System.out.println("Hello, " + input);
      System.out.print("How old are you? ");
      int input = in.nextInt();
      input++;
      System.out.println("Next year, you will be " + input);
   }
}

I believe that the issue is that a variable with the name input is classified 
both a String and an int. 

You can fix this by having different variable names for the string and for
the integer.
