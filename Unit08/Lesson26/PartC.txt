What is the output of the following code and why?
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Customer.lastSerialUsed = 100;
       Customer c1 = new Customer("Sal's Deli");
       c1.addSale(100);
       Customer c2 = c1;
       c2.addSale(50);
       System.out.println(c1.getSales());
       System.out.println(c2.getSales());
   }

(Use the Customer class we developed in class).

ANSWER: 
The output of the above program is 
    150
    150
This is because in line 12, c1 is set to c2. As both are now referencing the same object,
any changes to one will be made to both.
